**TRINSIC MODERN SLAVERY TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT**

**Introduction**

**Trinsic Technologies, Inc. and its affiliates ("Trinsic," "we," "us," "our") are founded on the principle of trust. We help companies verify identity using digital ID documents and systems, a role that demands the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and are committed to acting with integrity in all business dealings. This commitment extends to preventing acts of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labor, and human trafficking within our business and supply chains.**

**Our Business, Structure, and Supply Chains**

**Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Trinsic serves a global customer base. We are an aggregator of high-tech digital identity systems, integrating with government and commercial identity solutions in over 35 countries.**

**Our core operations consist of employees in professional roles such as engineering, product development, sales, operations, and customer support.**

**Generally, the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain is low. Our suppliers are almost exclusively providers of highly technical solutions and professional services delivered by skilled professionals. However we still apply the following policies to ensure no modern slavery finds its way into our supply chain.**

**Our Commitment and Policies**

**Trinsic's commitment to ethical conduct is embedded in our corporate policies and culture.**

**Employee Code of Conduct: Our Code of Conduct sets the standard for ethical behavior expected of all employees, requiring compliance with all applicable laws and the highest principles of business integrity.**

**Responsible Disclosure Policy: We maintain a Responsible Disclosure Policy that provides a clear and confidential channel for employees and external parties to report any concerns, including potential human rights violations, without fear of retaliation.**

**Hiring and Employment Practices: We are committed to fair and ethical employment. All our employees enter into employment voluntarily and are free to leave with reasonable notice. We conduct all legally required right-to-work checks for every employee. All employment rights, including grievance procedures, are clearly outlined in employment contracts and company policies to ensure they are understood and respected.**

**Due Diligence and Risk Management**

**We conduct due diligence to ensure our zero-tolerance policy is upheld in both our own operations and our supply chain.**

**Our Operations: The risk of modern slavery within our own business is negligible, as we directly employ professionals and are of a stage where each employee knows each other employee personally. But even as we scale, our recruitment and HR processes are designed to ensure all employees are recruited ethically and work for us willingly.**

**Our Supply Chains: We require our direct suppliers to contractually commit to complying with all applicable laws, including those related to human trafficking and slavery. We reserve the right to establish consequences for non-compliance, including terminating our relationship with any supplier found to be in breach of these laws. For employees responsible for supplier engagement, we provide training where applicable to ensure they understand our standards.**

**In the unlikely event that abuses were uncovered, Trinsic is committed to taking swift and appropriate action to protect vulnerable individuals and remedy the situation. To date, our processes have not identified any instances of slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain.**

**Trinsic is dedicated to upholding the principles of trust and integrity in every aspect of our business. Our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery is a critical component of this commitment. This statement reflects our ongoing dedication to ensuring that slavery and human trafficking have no place in our business or our supply chains.**
