("Trinsic", "Company", "we", "us" and "our") uses cookies and other similar technologies to recognize you when you visit https://trinsic.id/ (the "Website") and provide certain functionality through the software and platform accessible through the Website (the "Application"). The Website and Application are collectively referred to as the "Services". The single term "cookies" is used to refer to cookies and other similar technologies.

Please take the time to read this Cookie Policy carefully. Should you have any questions in relation to any of the foregoing, or should you wish to exercise your rights, please contact legal\@trinsic.id.

1\. WHAT ARE COOKIES? WHY DO WE USE THEM?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.

We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our Website, to make our Website work, as well as to provide us with useful information about your journey on our Website.

We also use cookies to enable important security features of our Application.

Cookies also help us to analyze traffic and usage trends in connection with our Services. This allows us to understand, among other things, who is using the Services, how they are using them, where they get stuck, and other ways to improve the Services. These cookies and persistent device identifiers collect and store information including, but not limited to time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page, IP address, unique device ID, advertising tags, and type of operating system used. We may retain aggregated logs or other anonymized versions of this data indefinitely.

Besides classic cookies, we may use similar techniques, such as flash cookies, tags, pixels, device fingerprinting, cross-device tracking, html5-local storage, javascripts, web beacons, software development kits (SDKs), etc. These techniques may be used to deliver cookies, track the number of visits to the Services, understand Service usage and effectiveness, and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.

2\. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOKIES?

Cookies can be categorized according to different criteria, one of which is the domain which placed the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by the website you are visiting (eg. cookies placed by Trinsic when you're visiting the Website). Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting.

In addition, by categorizing cookies according to their purpose, you will receive more information on the benefits and the results of the cookie. In that context, we distinguish the following categories:

-   **Strictly necessary cookies** are essential for a website to work properly;

-   **Analytical / performance cookies** collect information about how you use the Website (e.g. which web pages/features you access most often, which allows us to improve the Website);

-   **Functionality cookies** allow the Website to remember your choices (e.g. your username, language, currency, or region) and to provide enhanced, personalized, or customized features;

-   **Targeting or advertising cookies** are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests based on an analysis of your browsing.

As the first category of cookies are necessary for a website to function, these do not require your consent. The other categories of cookies can only be dropped with your consent, which you are free to give and withdraw anytime.

3\. HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?
