**Secure Development**: Trinsic integrates security considerations into its software development lifecycle, including practices such as secure coding guidelines and security testing before deployment.

**Vendor Management**: Trinsic performs due diligence on Sub-Processors and critical vendors handling Personal Data to assess their security practices and ensure appropriate contractual safeguards are in place.

**Change Management**: Trinsic utilizes a formal change management process for changes to the production environment, including testing, review, and approval procedures, to minimize security risks and operational disruptions.

Trinsic's Chief Technology Officer (or their successors, as outlined in Trinsic's Business Continuity Plan), is responsible for maintaining the company's security posture. The CTO may be contacted directly at [[security\@trinsic.id]{.underline}](mailto:security@trinsic.id).

**SECTION III -- SECURITY MEASURES**

Data Importer shall implement and maintain for the duration of this DPA the technical, administrative, and organizational safeguards described in Annex B of this DPA. These safeguards include, at a minimum:

> a\) Governance and oversight of internal processes, including documented security policies, assignment of security responsibilities, and periodic risk assessments; and
>
> b\) Logical, physical, and procedural controls designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of Personal Data during its collection, transmission, processing, and storage.

Such measures satisfy the requirements of Article 46 of the LGPD and the Brazilian SCCs, and they apply equally to all categories of Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal Data and data relating to children and adolescents. Given the scope and depth of the safeguards in Annex B, the Parties agree that no additional safeguards applicable exclusively to minors' data shall be required.

The Data Importer will periodically review and, where appropriate, enhance these measures to ensure they continue to provide a level of protection consistent with applicable law and these Clauses.
