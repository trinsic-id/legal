These third-party services may include anonymous site metrics, analytics services, payment processing, task management services, order fulfillment, mailing services, maintaining databases and other features or services included in or necessary for the Services. When we employ another party to perform a function of this nature, we:

-   Only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.

-   Ensure appropriate contractual safeguards, including data processing agreements (DPAs).

-   Require all third-party providers to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal information.

-   Prohibit the use of personal information for any purpose other than the contracted services.

6.2 For Legal and Safety Purposes.

Company third-party service providers store and transmit personal information in compliance with appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

7.3 Security Breach. We maintain sufficient technical safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of your personal information. However, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure or error-free, so it is never possible to guarantee absolute security. If required by law, and in the event of a high risk to your personal data, Company shall give prompt notice to you of any unauthorized access to personal information and shall immediately commence a thorough investigation into any such incident.

7.4 Company Not Liable for Breach.
